                    <p>
                        I was born in Bogota, Colombia in May 10th, 1993. I have always had a passion for numbers, soccer, and nature; I have
                        been fortunate enough to dedicate time and effort into these three different aspects of my life, being able to go to the United
                        States to complete my college education through an athletic scholarship and to play soccer at the same time in a different country 
                        opened up my mind and made me easily adaptable to any new environment. I like adventure and to take risks for something that
                        is valuable to me and the planet.
